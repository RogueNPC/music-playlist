# music-playlist
 
This program allows users to store songs in a playlist in the form of a linked list.

The program initializes with an empty playlist and from there the user can view song objects in their playlist, add song objects to the list, remove song objects from the list, search for a specific song from the list, and find the amount of songs on their list.

This project was coded using Python 3.7.9.
